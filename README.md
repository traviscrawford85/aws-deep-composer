Absolutely incredible and fresh-pressed Google Colab Notebook to train and generate Music with the SOTA GGA-MG (AR-CNN) Hybrid Neural Network (AI).

## Amazon Deep Composer is a composition augmentation AI. 

For now it is limited by 16Bars (twice the original) but I am working on fixing that and pushing it to at least 64 bars.

Huge thanks and all the credit for this SOTA Google Colab go out to Amazon AWS AI team and Jeff Bezos in particular :) Thank you for this fantastic gift :)
